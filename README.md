# Am I Being Productive?

Heyhey.. I've made a website!

🤖 Am I Being Productive?

Welcome to my first ever official website, built with my own hands, a lot of coffee, and some questionable life choices at 2 AM.

This little site will call you out if you’re just scrolling endlessly instead of getting work done.
No judgement… okay maybe a little judgement. 😏
